## 4. Project Management Approach

### Task Allocation & Tracking

- **Platform**: ClickUp
- **Methodology**: Agile Scrum
- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Task Assignment**: Tasks assigned via ClickUp based on sprint goals and team capacity
- **Tracking**: Status updates, priority tags, and dependencies managed within ClickUp

**Definition of Done (DoD):** A task is considered complete when peer-reviewed, tested, and merged into the `develop` branch.

**Risk-Based Prioritization:** High-risk tasks are prioritized earlier in sprints.

### Project Tracking

- **Dashboards**: Custom ClickUp dashboards for progress visualization
- **Burndown Charts**: Auto-generated per sprint
- **Milestone Reviews**: Held at the end of each sprint
